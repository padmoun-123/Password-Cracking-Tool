# Password Cracking Tool

This project demonstrates a basic password cracking tool written in Python. It uses two common techniques: brute-force and dictionary attacks to crack SHA-256 hashed passwords. The project is educational and meant for cybersecurity learning.

## Features
- **Brute-force Attack**: Tries every possible combination of characters up to a specific length.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses a list of common passwords to match against a hashed password.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Hashlib (comes pre-installed with Python)

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Password-Cracking-Tool.git
