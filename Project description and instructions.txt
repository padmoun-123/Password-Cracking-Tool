### **Step 5: Keep Improving and Updating Your Project**

As you gain more skills and knowledge, you can continue enhancing this project by:

- Supporting multiple hash algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1, SHA256).
- Optimizing the brute force method for better performance.
- Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use.
- Adding a progress bar to show the current status of the attack.

### **Conclusion**
Now your project is ready to be shared on GitHub, and you have a **well-documented repository** with a professional README. This will make it easier for others (and future employers) to understand and appreciate your work.
